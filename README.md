# tu-challenge
Coding challenge for CRUD/Not-Quite-RESTful application.

### What is a `tuRecord`?
The coding challenge was assigned by a company I've abbreviated with a non-specific spec -- in staying true to that challenge, I'm using `tuRecord` to denote the date construct in the challenge's spec.

### How to get this working:
1. Create a .env file from the .env.example file.
2. `npm install`
3. `npx knex migrate:latest`
4. `npm run start`
